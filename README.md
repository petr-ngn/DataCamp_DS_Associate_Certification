# DataCamp_DS_Associate_Certification
DataCamp Case Study for Data Scientist Associate certification.

This case study regards a motorcycles manufacturer company and its selling of mopeds. Regarding the mopeds, they often received reviews from people who never owned a moped before, therefore they do not want consider such reviews and would like to find a way to identify reviews from these peole.

Based on the received reviews, our goal is to build a classification model to predict which reviews come from peole who have never owned the moped before.

Such case study includes following tasks:
1. Data Validation (_data dictionary checks, data cleaning_)
2. Exploratory Analysis (_data exploration, visualizations, data preparation_)
3. Model Fitting (_training of the baseline model and the comparison model, hyperparameter tuning_)
4. Model Evaluation (_performance of both model, comparison of results_)
